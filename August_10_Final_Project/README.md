I made significant progress on my final project, but I still have not been able to implement the motors in the shower. The shower states are still not working, so that is something I need to figure out. Also the final look of the timer is incomplete: I need to make the colorings correct and add shower facts. I also need to create the lever arms for the shower and a makeshift set up, however that can only be done once I figure out the situation with the motors.
