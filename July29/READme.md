NOTE: I included the Arduino button in playGame2.pde file in the gameCode folder


For this assignment, I used Arduino to improve my game state system from my midterm. Rather than pressing on the screen to restart the game, I used a button. When the button is pressed, the game reverts to the starting screen (the first image below), and the score resets. Also, in the Processing print section below, it writes that the game has restarted.

I had the most difficulty setting up the Arduino section in Processing. For this, I looked at many examples in the Processing library for inspiration. I always kept forgetting the meaning of "null" and its uses. I also forgot to add the "serial. Available" function, which was a significant factor in my initial trial failures. For this activity, I learned useful vocabulary and symbols that I otherwise would not have given much attention to, such as null and "!=". It was most fun to see how Processing and Arduino came together to create one cohesive result. I most enjoyed applying my previous Processing skills to add the button aspect, and it was interesting to see the difference in code.
