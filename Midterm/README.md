Cookie Craze Maze Part 2

In this game, the objective is for the "cookie" monster to go through the maze and try to eat 20 cookies. If you touch any blue lines or boxes, you lose the game. My original inspiration for this game came from a game I used to play as a kid: the Impossible Game. I created obstacle boxes and a maze path that you have to navigate with your cursor to collect 20 cookies. I decided to let the cookies stay on the screen, rather than make them disappear, because they are randomly moving, and navigating the cursor through the maze is already so difficult. I added chomping cookie sounds for when the score increase, and background music to the game. I also drew my title screens to add a personalized and less computerized touch. 

Compared to the game that I created for the last homework assignment, the finished product is much better in terms of functionality and visual aspects. I remember from my previous project that I was not able to have any wall collision detectors whatsoever. I wasn't able to make a scoreboard or have the boxes move in a completely random order. After learning about the topic of computer vision and pixels, though, I knew there was a solution to my problem When completing the midterm, I again struggled the most with getting the mouse cursor to detect "wall" collisions. After many hours of trial and error, I would realize a fault in my process: I was not thinking creatively. I was caught up with trying to follow the example for computer vision, rather than utilize it. I wanted to pursue it line-by-line, but in the end, I realized that the game would not work unless I altered some parts of the code. I was scared to try something different - track for a specific color, rather than a range - because I was unfamiliar with it. From this, I learned that I often struggle to take risks; I find comfort in the known, but this assignment (and this class in general) has been teaching me that I need to be okay with feeling uncomfortable and trying something new. 

I had the most fun watching the game come together in general. After overcoming that substantial setback, I found joy in the "yes I got it!" moments. Those were most satisfying, and it what motivates me to continue to code.
