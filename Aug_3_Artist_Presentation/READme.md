I spent a lot of time researching artists that code during the assignment, but I would say I was most intrigued by Zach Lieberman because of his use of motion and digital videos and images. He is one of the co-creators of openFrameworks, an open-source toolkit for creative programming with C ++. One of the company's mission statements is for coders to find a simple place for experimentation and to find a community of people with similar interests. He does complete much of his work with C++, and he uses computer vision extensively. 

I decided to also make a piece of art on Processing that was inspired by Lieberman's use of motion. I got help from a tutorial by the Coding Train (linked in my pde) to create a moving background. It was my first time using the 3D function in Processing, so it was enjoyable to use something new. The most challenging part of that was changing the stroke color to be randomized at a certain speed. I had the same struggle at the beginning of this course, but this time I overcame that obstacle by using the millis () function. I am most proud of that accomplishment because I had not been able to solve that issue before.
