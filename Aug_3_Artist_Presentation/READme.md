I spent a lot of time researching artists that code during the assignment, but I would say I was most intrigued by Zach Lieberman because of his use of motion and digital videos and images. He is one of the co-creators of openFrameworks, an open-source toolkit for creative programming with C ++. One of the company's mission statements is for coders to find a simple place for experimentation and to find a community of people with similar interests. He does complete much of his work with C++, and he uses computer vision extensively. 

I decided to also make a piece of art on Processing that was inspired by Lieberman's use of motion. I got help from a tutorial by the Coding Train (linked in my pde) to create a moving background. It was my first time using the 3D function in Processing, so it was enjoyable to use something new. The most challenging part of that was changing the stroke color to be randomized at a certain speed. I had the same struggle at the beginning of this course, but this time I overcame that obstacle by using the millis () function. I am most proud of that accomplishment because I had not been able to solve that issue before.

SLIDE LECTURE NOTES:

**slide two**: Zach Lieberman was born in 1977 in New York. 
He is one of the co-creators of openFrameworks which is an open source toolkit for creative programming with C ++. Development on the site can be collaborative, so you can work on projects independently, but you can also give feedback on work on projects with others all around the world. Lieberman is currently part of the MITmedia lab where he works with human gestures to create unique art. He does complete much of his work with C++ and he uses computer vision extensively. He’s also interested in printing. I read a recent interview of him from the Verge where Lieberman plans to dabble in the world of printing and digital art. 

**slide three**: 
Landlines - The first work that I saw of Lieberman’s, and it was this exact same thing that inspired me to research him. It’s a great example of him using interactivity and human creativity of the lines to draw something more concrete. In this project, he initially used lines detection in the images. More specifically, he used a plugin called ridge detection which turned an image into a set of lines.

Reflection Studies - in this next piece, he uses light to create art. He used a camera to capture shapes over a light table, and depending on how close the shape is to the table, the more opaque the shape is on the screen. The background was also consistently changing color as you moved the objects across the table. 

Hag Seed - This is another computer vision project that he did. I chose this because it was actually for a book whose author I really like: Margaret Atwood. It was to promote her book Hag-Seed. Lieberman took words from her book and used them to surround the person, and as the person moved, the word followed. What I really like about this piece was that the way the words flowed was not the same. In this first picture, it is around the person, but in this image, it shows the words inside. 

**slide four**: 
This next project is called eyeWrite. Actually, Lieberman and a group of other engineers and coders received the 2010 Prix Ars Electronica award which is awarded to people in the field of electronic and interactive art. They created an open source eye tracker system for people who suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. These patients lose muscle control due to nerve cell damage. The team took a pair of sunglasses and a webcam with an LED light to track eye movement and blinks which was then projected onto a screen. This project was initially designed for graffiti artist Tony Quan who is fully paralyzed and is only able to control his eyes but the long term goal was to bring art to ALS patients. I personally thought this project was really cool because the team didn’t use equipment that was super expensive and they also a camera that is more accessible today, so this project can really be recreated anywhere. 

**slide five**: 
I also looked a lot at Lieberman’s work on his instagram because he regularly updates there. These aren’t interactive, but they were very intriguing to me. 
The first one is polyhedra. Polyhedra is a shape that follows an equation called Euler’s Polyhedron Formula that determines the number of vertices, faces, and edges. So the shapes don’t look the same, but they are still classified as a polyhedra. To me, it looks almost as if he drew shapes, rather than code. Each shape is shaded in such a way that it looks like he used a pencil and it reminds me of a minimalist take to space. Also, the movement of the shapes. It looks like the shapes are approaching you, then there’s some sort of hesitation, and then it comes close to only pulling away quickly. 
The second one is called pebble path. It more so reminds me of the moon rather than pebbles because of the color scheme and texture of the pebbles. What drew me to this art was how the pebbles looked very realistic in the front to the more blurred background which was very intriguing. Also the movement. To me, it looks like the pebble is dancing. I noticed that in a lot of Lieberman’s work he like to incorporate unique types of motion that really bring art to life.

**slide six**:
Here, I attempted to make my own art inspired by Lieberman
