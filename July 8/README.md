This is an image of me at my grandparent's home. As a child, this was my most favorite space to be in as the room was "off-limits" for children and reserved for guests. Though being "forbidden," I often spent most of my time in this room growing up. The room is unique in that it has a red sofa with a matching red carpet and a large gold-colored mirror. When completing this assignment, I originally planned on including scalloping on the edge of the mirror. After spending many hours writing code for just one row of scallops, I noticed how inefficiently I was using my time. As a result, I looked towards the looping feature. I decided to bring the scale of the image forward so I could use the feature, rather than having to draw arcs around the mirror continually. I discovered the hidden "color" feature in the tool section, which was very helpful. Getting help from my peers in Slack helped me the most, especially when I was lost in my looping problem.
