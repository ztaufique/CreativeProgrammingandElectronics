For this assignment, I was initially inspired to do a Christmas themed musical "instrument" after watching an episode of Phineas and Ferb about Christmas in July. I sought out to have three different songs played, which the user was able to choose, and the servo move back and forth to represent the jingle bells. The button (switch #2) was used to control if the bell was on or off. I used the photoresistor (switch #1) to control which song would be played: if the light were very high, All I Want for Christmas would play, if the light was at a medium value, Let it Snow was played, and if the light was low or at a value of zero, Jingle Bells would play. 

Automating the servo and the piezo buzzer at the same time was the most challenging part of the assignment for me. I initially used the delay () function to run through each song, but I quickly learned that it would not be possible to have each aspect of the instrument work simultaneously. Using inspiration from Professor Shiloh's music example, I used the concept of time to determine when the music would be played and how the servo would function. My downfall was when I wanted to use the button to control if the servo was on or off with the button. No matter how I would code, the buttons would only affect the speed of the music, rather than the servo. As a result, the button now only has a minuscule difference when pressed. It allows the servo to decrease the speed slightly, but barely enough to notice. In the end, I take the video of the servo without the button function to show how the bells would be mimicked.
