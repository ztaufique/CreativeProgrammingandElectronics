**Write a first draft of a short proposal for your final project.**
   
    Must be creative, broadly defined
    Must use Arduino and Processing (i.e. communication)
    Exceptions: If your project is sufficiently complex I will allow only Arduino or only Processing
    Must be responsive
    A person using your project must perceive it to be responding instantly
    You may use any resources you can find. You may add items you have at home or wish to purchase, you may use any libraries, examples, circuits, or parts of code;      you may be inspired by projects.

For my final project, I decided to create a **smart shower**. I have many younger siblings (ranging from 5 - 11) that often take up to 30 minutes in the shower, singing, dancing, and doing everything that is far from the purpose of a shower. With so many people at my house - my grandparents, siblings, and parents - water wastage is inevitable. So, I decided that I wanted to create something that helps reduce this problem. The smart shower's purpose is to track the amount of time for each task: soap, shampoo, conditioner, and rinsing. After a total of 7 minutes, the shower will be automatically turned off using the motors. A button will be on the Arduino, which will initiate the Smart Shower: it will turn on the shower. I will use Processing as a running timer and warning screen. Anytime a timer for a specific task goes off, the piezo buzzer will be buzzed, and the screen will turn to a different color. When the time runs out, an Arduino motor will turn the water off in the shower. To protect the equipment, I will need to use waterproof material such as plastic bags and containers.

What I will include:
   1. Button to turn on the system
   2. Waterproof chamber made out of plastic containers
   3. Some sort of tape or small plastic tube for the USD cable to feed through
   4. Motors to turn the shower on and off
   5. The "shower" app which is the Processing Window
