**Write a first draft of a short proposal for your final project.**
   
    Must be creative, broadly defined
    Must use Arduino and Processing (i.e. communication)
    Exceptions: If your project is sufficiently complex I will allow only Arduino or only Processing
    Must be responsive
    A person using your project must perceive it to be responding instantly
    You may use any resources you can find. You may add items you have at home or wish to purchase, you may use any libraries, examples, circuits, or parts of code;      you may be inspired by projects.

For my final project, I decided to create a **smart shower**. I have many younger siblings (ranging from 5 - 11) that often take up to 30 minutes in the shower, singing, dancing, and doing everything that is far from the purpose of a shower. With so many people at my house - my grandparents, siblings, and parents - water wastage is inevitable. So, I decided that I wanted to create something that helps reduce this problem. The smart shower's purpose is to track the amount of time for each task: soap, shampoo, conditioner, and rinsing. After a total of 7 minutes, the shower will be automatically turned off using the motors. There will be a button on the Processing window, which will initiate the Smart Shower: it will turn on the shower. I will also use Processing as a running timer and warning screen. Anytime a timer for a specific task goes off, the piezo buzzer will be buzzed, and the screen will turn to a different color. When the time runs out, an Arduino motor will turn the water off in the shower. To protect the equipment, I will need to use waterproof material such as plastic bags and containers.

What I will include:
   1. The "shower" app which is the Processing Window
   2. Waterproof chamber made out of plastic containers
   3. Some sort of tape or small plastic tube for the USD cable to feed through
   4. Motors to turn the shower on and off
   
I know least about the movement of the motors and the "H Bridge." The most difficult/challenging part of this project will be to determine the strength needed to move the shower knob and build the exact mechanism. I can try to mitigate the challenge by starting to tackle this problem early on; I will test each shower in my house for the least resistance and build multiple devices to attach to the motor. Connecting the piezo buzzer to the Arduino after a certain number of minutes will be a bit tricky to implement. I will need to find a specific mechanism that will amplify the sound of the buzzer as well. 

There is a significant risk of water damage in this project, so I will need to use/buy supplies that are good for protecting devices from water, such as duct tape, plastic containers. I also plan to create an extra overhang above the device that will further prevent water penetration.
