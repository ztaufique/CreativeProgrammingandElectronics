Write a first draft of a short proposal for your final project. Final project requirements: 

Must be creative, broadly defined
Must use Arduino and Processing (i.e. communication)
Exceptions: If your project is sufficiently complex I will allow only Arduino or only Processing
Must be responsive
A person using your project must perceive it to be responding instantly
You may use any resources you can find. You may add items you have at home or wish to purchase, you may use any libraries, examples, circuits, or parts of code; you may be inspired by projects.
