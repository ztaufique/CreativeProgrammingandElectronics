When completing this assignment, I was inspired by the computer games I used to play as a child. I wanted to build an interactive maze with shooted blocks and maze lines that were "dangerous" to touch. 

I found the "class" feature to be most helpful for the moving squares because I only had to code 5 of them. The class feature was something I have not seen before, mostly due to my limited coding experience, but I'm most proud of the animated squares. This homework assignment also showed me the true value of thoroughly commenting as it was useful to look back at when I was referring back to old code. I used lines to create the maze, along with images for the Cookie Monster and the cookie. Using images was very helpful in that I was able to upload a high quality image rather than trying to draw one using Processing. 

However, I was unable to excecute the "lose" and "win" game states. I spent many hours trying to figure out how to get the code to read "lose" after hitting a certain block, and I was unsuccessful. I attempted to use the "color" objects. For a moment I was successful because the "lose" screen was loading, but it was resulting immediately after I pressed "start", not when the character hit a box or a line.
