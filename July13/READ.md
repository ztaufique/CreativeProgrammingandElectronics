I was initially inspired to do some type of animal when I looked at Alan Turing's work. I was drawn to his use of inverted colors such as that of a leopard. The the background was the leopard pattern, while the actual animal was black. Admittingly, I started this homework asssignemnt with quite an ambitious mindeset: I wanted to draw multiple koi fish that would swim to the mouse. I was humbled when I saw the look of my first fish; I couldn't even recognize if it was a fish or a giant blob on the screen. From this, I learned the processing many limitations in the draw feature, but it is up to my creativity with how to work with it. Alas, I settled for the look of a simple green fish in a small pond. I did, however, discover the feature of "bezier" line. This was really useful in that I did not have to painstakingly draw the fish with arbuitrary curves and coordinatinate; I drew one bezier line to create the shape of the fish.


I realized the importance of conditional statements in Processing as it guided most of my work. I used conditional statements to create the effect of "easing." As the food immediatley followed the cursor, the fish followed at a slower pace. I used the concept of gravity in processing to guide my work. However, my shortcoming was the background. I attempted to randomize the color, which I was successful, but the frame rate is extremeley fast. To remedy this, I set up a boolean statement, but for some reason, the only color that appeared was the fish food color. I settled for the fast frame rate, and I was successful in getting the fish to follow the food. In this assignment, I discovered that there are many ways to get one thing done. I often took the inefficient route, which ate up a majority of my time when completing the assignment. As a result, the finished product looks rushed and not detailed.
