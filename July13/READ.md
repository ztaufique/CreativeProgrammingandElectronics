# I was initially inspired to do some type of animal when I looked at Alan Turing's work. I  started this homework assignment with hopes to draw multiple koi fish following the mouse to grab the food. I realized the importance of conditional statements in Processing as it guided most of my work. However, my shortcoming was the background. I attempted to randomize the color, which I was successful, but the frame rate is extremeley fast. To remedy this, I set up a boolean statement, but for some reason, the only color that appeared was the fish food color. I settled for the fast frame rate, and I was successful in getting the fish to follow the food. In this assignment, I discovered that there are many ways to get one thing done. I often took the inefficient route, which ate up a majority of my time when completing the assignment. As a result, the finished product looks rushed and not detailed.
